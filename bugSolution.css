To solve the specificity issue, we need to adjust the selectors to ensure the intended style is applied. We could make the less specific selector more specific by adding more attributes or increase the weight (importance) of the style rules or utilize the !important flag if appropriate and understanding the implications.  In this case we'll adjust the selectors to ensure the correct styles are applied based on intended style hierarchy.
